## Active Learning project mission
The ALP mission is to provide a blueprint for a better internet and empower a new generation of developers.

## Build the site
To set up the site locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  and Yarn installed. You can check if these are installed by running the following commands:

```
node -v


yarn -v
```

After you have installed Node.js and Yarn, you can install the dependencies using yarn and start the local preview:
```
yarn

yarn start
```

Once started, a live preview is available at http://localhost:4200/.
